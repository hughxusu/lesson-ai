The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.

In short, this place is a downscale version of Denny's.  It's not very fancy, but the food is good and cheap.  \\n\\nJust like Denny's, the place is open 24 hours, and they serve everything on their menu all day.  When I went, I had the scrambled eggs (egg whites only) with homestyle potatoes and toast.  My order was supposed to come with bacon or sausage, but I'm vegetarian and declined it.  The waitress was very kind to let me have fruit in lieu of the meat.  I got my food about five minutes after I ordered it, and it tasted very similar to what I would eat at Denny's.\\n\\nThe El Cortez is a very low-rent hotel in Downtown Las Vegas, so don't expect to see any high rollers sitting around this restaurant.  When I was eating here, I noticed that most of the other patrons were elderly people.  I don't like to make assumptions, but most of them didn't seem like they had lots of disposable income, and probably shouldn't be hanging around a casino, gambling with money they can't really afford to lose.  But I suppose that's none of my business.\\n\\nIf diner food is what you're looking for, this is a decent place to find it.  If you're looking for something a little more up-scale or exotic, walk outside to Fremont Street.  There are many good restaurants within a short walk of this place.

So, Mac's Speed Shop gets my first review (and it goes for this location and the other I've visited on Sandy Porter Road in the Steele Creek area).\\n\\nFirst, the place knows what it is and does everything possible to make sure you enjoy yourself. Servers are attentive &amp; knowledgable, service is fast, but you're also welcome to take your time and enjoy the extensive beer list for as long as you'd like.\\n\\nSecond, the food's consistently top notch. It isn't the truest NC BBQ you'll find, so a hard-core traditionalist may not rave about it, but they have the right mix of variety and restraint that gives everyone in your party an option that's going to be GOOD. Other \\\"wing\\\" places need to recognize that these grilled &amp; smokey wings are the best in town. Hungry for a steak? Try the KC Beef Rib instead. You'll feel like Fred Flintstone when it's put in front of you and like the luckiest yelper on earth when you're finished. \\n\\nAnd if you're there with five or six friends, please (PLEASE) take on the Fatboy Challenge together. For less than $50 you'll all get to try the best sandwich in Charlotte without the nasty side effects of trying to eat 5+ pounds of food by yourself. It's sweet, smokey, and surprisingly spicy on a great loaf of Ciabatta. Plus you get a big ol' bowl of Mac N Cheese and a pitcher of beer included on the tab.\\n\\nThird, that beer list. Mac's gets a little bit of everything and has the prettiest lineup of taps I've seen in this town. They have some cheaper domestic tall boys if that's your thing, but please do yourself the favor of asking the well-versed bartenders for a taste of something new or a recommendation based on your usual drink. You'll be better for it.\\n\\nFinally, as a Steelers fan, I love having this caliber of place to go on game days. Any football fan should have Mac's on their list of destinations for Monday Nights, too... a good chunk (if not all) of their drafts are always 1/2 off on Monday. Best deal in town.</td>\n",

His dad also has the same book and used his coupon for Anntony's yesterday for lunch. His dad is not one to call us and rave about a place, but he said we needed to check it out. We checked out the menu that was advertised in the book to see if the food matched our tastes. I was excited to see they offered Caribbean Crab Cakes so we headed out to Anntony's for dinner.\\n\\nWhen we walked in at 6:45, there was not a single person in the restaurant. We sat down and were handed menu's that differed from the menu in the entertainment book. I checked their menu on-line after dinner and found it to be correct with the menu at the restaurant though. The menu consisted of all chicken and some pork options. I was really disappointed to find that no crab-cake listed. In addition, their menu did not supply a description of the entrees, but it did for their sides. I found the menu very underwhelming. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken wing dinner that was tossed in a special Caribbean sauce with their black beans and mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with collard greens and rice. The wings were okay, some were dry and some were not. He said his chicken tasted like it was leftover from lunch and was dry as well. The beans, mac and cheese, and rice were very good though. \\n\\nTheir slogan is \\\"Don't Worry About Nothin' Mon!\\\" I WISH! I was very worried while I was dining for the following reasons: \\n-They had two TVs on that showed depressing world events (Not sure why a restaurant has TVs in it, it's not a bar). \\n-The server, although very pleasant and sweet, did not have her hair tied back and wore a strapless dress with flip flops. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out a bottle of sauce with out a lid on it. Where was the Health Department when we needed them? \\n-Why were we the only people in the restaurant??? \\n\\n\\nI can only assume that my boyfriends dad liked the place so much was due to the amount of food you get with the low priced meals and that lunch was a bit fresher than dinner. \\n\\nI would not recommend this place for dinner. Maybe lunch is better, but the food safety and health issues are a bit concerning.</td>\n",
